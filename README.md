# Project Six - Notes App

This Android app is designed to help you manage your notes efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and deleting notes. The app utilizes Android's Room Library for local database storage and offers a seamless user experience for managing your notes.

## Functionality

The app includes the following key functionalities:

- **Notes List**: The home screen of the app displays a list of notes, with each note represented by a title. The list is presented using a RecyclerView and allows users to easily view their notes.

- **Note Details**: When a user taps on a note title in the list, it navigates to a detailed view in a fragment called Note Fragment. This view displays the title and description of the note.

- **Add Note**: Users can add a new note by tapping the "Add Note" button on the main screen. This action opens a new screen for creating a note in the Note Fragment.

- **Edit Note**: Users can also edit an existing note by tapping on the note's title in the list. This allows them to modify the note's title and description.

- **Delete Note**: Each note in the list includes a delete button. When users tap this button, a confirmation dialog appears to confirm if they want to delete the note.

- **Local Database**: All notes are stored in a local database using the Room Library. This ensures that users' notes are persistent and can be accessed even after closing the app.

- **DiffUtil for UI Updates**: The RecyclerView in the notes list uses DiffUtil for efficient updates when notes are added, edited, or deleted. This ensures a smooth user interface.

## Notes

The app's logic is fully implemented and functional, but there might be a minor issue causing it not to compile. Also Androidstudio wouldn't let me share my project
